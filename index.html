      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>Hi, I'm Anshu Arunav from Grade 6. I built NeoPark — an automatic parking gate that opens and closes using sensors and an RFID card. I was inspired by the problems I saw at real parking lots and wanted to create something better, safer, and smarter!</p>

    <section class="neopark-section">
      <h2>NeoPark Features</h2>
      <p>NeoPark is designed to manage parking spaces efficiently without the need for on-site staff. It ensures secure access, real-time slot tracking, and smooth vehicle flow.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="how-it-works">
      <h2>How NeoPark Works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>IR Sensor 1 detects the car at the gate.</li>
        <li>The LCD shows "Scan your card."</li>
        <li>If the RFID card is valid, the gate opens.</li>
        <li>The car passes through IR Sensor 2, and the gate closes after 2 seconds.</li>
        <li>The display updates the available slots in real time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What I Learned</h2>
      <p>This project was not easy! I had to fix bugs in the code, make sure the sensors were placed correctly, and even solve power issues. But I never gave up. I learned about electronics, coding, and how real engineers solve problems.</p>

    <section class="future">
      <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
      <p>In the future, I want to upgrade NeoPark by adding a mobile app, solar power, and even license plate detection. Maybe one day, it can be used in real malls or offices!</p>
